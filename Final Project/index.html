      <p>
        Truco is a traditional card game that holds a special place in the culture of Argentina and other parts of South America.
        Often played with the Spanish deck (Baraja Española), Truco is more than just a game—it's a blend of strategy, bluff,
        psychology, and humor. Its roots trace back to Spanish settlers, and over time, the game has evolved to reflect the identity
        and spirit of the regions where it's played.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically enjoyed in social gatherings, bars, and family reunions, Truco is known for its unique vocabulary, expressive gestures,
        and thrilling gameplay mechanics like "Envido" and "Truco" calls. Players often raise the stakes and try to outwit their opponents
        not only through strong cards, but with bold bluffs and clever acting. It's a game that rewards personality as much as skill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a seasoned player or completely new, learning Truco gives you a window into Argentine tradition and community values.
        So get ready to play, learn the signals, master the rules—and above all, have fun!
